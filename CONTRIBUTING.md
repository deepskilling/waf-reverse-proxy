cargo build

# 4. Run tests to ensure everything works
cargo test

# 5. Install Python dependencies for scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Run tests and checks
cargo test                    # Run tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Check for issues
cargo fmt                    # Format code

# 4. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# 5. Push to your fork

## üìú Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Follow Rust conventions**: Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- **Write clear code**: Prefer readability over cleverness
- **Add comments**: Document complex logic and public APIs
